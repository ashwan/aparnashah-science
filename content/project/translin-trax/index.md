Expression of genes can be regulated at several levels in different
ways. The microRNA system is one way of controlling which genes will be
expressed i.e. form proteins. MicroRNAs are \~ 22 nucleotide long
segments of RNAs. A cell has hundreds of microRNAs. Each microRNA can
bind to dozens of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and prevent these mRNAs from
forming proteins, hence silencing them. If the cell needs to synthesize
these proteins in response to extracellular signals, it needs a way to
degrade the microRNA and reverse gene silencing (release the brake).
There are several enzymes that degrade subsets of microRNAs. These could
help regulate gene expression in a precise manner. We are investigating
the role of one such microRNA-degrading enzyme called the translin/trax
(TN/TX) complex in health and disease. One way of addressing this
research question is to study the impact of loss of the TN/TX complex.
Accordingly, we are studying the traits that are presented by TN KO mice
that lack the TN/TX complex (due to deletion of the translin gene from
their genome).We observed that these mice have a robust increase in fat
mass. Excess fat is a major risk factor for metabolic diseases such as
diabetes. Yet, surprisingly, TN KO mice do not have any impairment in
glucose tolerance. We characterized the mice further to determine what
was contributing to this 'protection' and identified three potential
factors. Unlike, mice who have a comparable increase in fat (due to a
high-fat diet), TN KO mice have 1) elevated levels of adiponectin, a
protective agent released by fat cells, 2) decreased inflammation and 3)
a disproportionate increase in subcutaneous fat instead of visceral fat.
The former is less harmful than the latter. It is likely that
collectively, these factors may be attributing protection from the
detrimental consequences of increased fat in these mice. These findings
have implications for treating metabolic diseases such as diabetes.

Neuronal plasticity is essentially brought about by changes in number or
strength of synapses (connections) between neurons. This phenomenon
underlies several brain diseases and can bring about changes in
behavior. MicroRNAs may be critical drivers of this phenomenon.
Accordingly, we are exposing mice to different stimuli that are known to
induce changes in neuronal plasticity and assessing if TN/TX protein
level or enzyme activity is increased. Currently, I am investigating if
long-term stress exposure can alter the TN/TX levels or activity in a
brain region known to have changes in plasticity in response to stress.
If this happens to be the case, I will use genetically-modified mice
that lack TN/TX specifically in this brain region and check if these
mice are more prone to the detrimental effects of stress. We are also
testing behavioral and neurochemical responses to various drugs of abuse
in genetically-modified mice that lack the TN/TX enzyme in neurons that
produce and release dopamine, the primary neurotransmitter involved in
addiction. These studies will help us understand the role of this enzyme
in diseases such as depression and substance abuse.
