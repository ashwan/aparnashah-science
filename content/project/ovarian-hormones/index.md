Depression is more prevalent among women than men. Yet, very little is
known about the potential influence of female hormones, such as estrogen
and progesterone, on the action of antidepressant (AD) drugs that are commonly prescribed
to both, men and women. Therefore, we conducted a preclinical study to
address this. We focused our study on a classical AD drug called
Desipramine (sold as Norpramin) and widely prescribed to people of all genders. 

Desipramine blocks the reuptake of a neurochemical
messenger, norepinephrine, back into neurons by binding to the
norepinephrine transporter present on neuronal ends. To test the
influence of female hormones on this drug's action, we compared how
effective the drug was at inducing an antidepressant-like effect in
ovariectomized female rats in the absence and presence of female
hormones, using a well-established behavioral assay for measuring
antidepressant effects of treatments. We showed that, on a short
timescale, female hormones blocked the antidepressant-like effects of
desipramine altogether. Further analysis showed that the hormone
treatment itself did not alter norepinephrine reuptake nor did it
interfere with the binding of desipramine to its target, the
transporter.

Next, we tested if long-term hormone treatment would interfere with the
AD drug's action. First, we conducted a pilot study to determine the
appropriate dose of estrogen that the animals should be treated with in
order to achieve serum estrogen levels comparable to those seen during
the proestrus stage of the estrous cycle in normally cycling female
rats. Ovariectomized female rats were given three different doses of
estrogen in the form of pellets that were implanted under their skin.
Serum estrogen levels were measured on Day 18. These data helped us pick
an appropriate dose for our long-term study and were included in the
publication for the benefit of other researchers in the field. On a
longer timescale, the female hormones did not interfere with the drug's
action at the two doses of the drug that were tested. Interestingly, the
hormone treatment regimen itself had a pro-depressive effect. In
addition to the behavioral studies, we checked if the hormones altered
circulating levels of the AD drug. Despite receiving identical doses of
desipramine, drug levels were up to two-fold higher in animals who also
received hormone treatment compared to those that did not, possibly due
to an influence of the hormones on the metabolism of the drug. Taken
together, these studies suggest that female hormones may not interfere
with desipramine treatment in women. However, one has to be careful
about the dose prescribed as serum levels of the drug were much higher
in the presence of female hormones. These studies also emphasize the
importance of treatment duration when designing studies to determine
possible interactions between hormones (or other drugs) and AD drugs.
