This research focused on investigating the biological pathways that are
involved in the antidepressant effects of vagal nerve stimulation (VNS),
an FDA-approved therapeutic intervention for patients with
treatment-resistant depression (TRD) i.e those who do not respond to
multiple trials with antidepressant medications or electroconvulsive
therapy. Clinical data showed that VNS is effective in TRD patients;
yet, the biological rationale behind its beneficial effects were
unclear. To address this gap in knowledge, we conducted preclinical
studies using stimulators and settings that were similar to those used
clinically.

First, we demonstrated that repeated administration of VNS produced
positive behavioral effects in rats. Short-term VNS treatment had an
antidepressant-like effect whereas long-term VNS treatment reduced both,
anxiety- and depression-like, symptoms. We then used toxins or
inhibitors to block or destroy one neurobiological system at a time and
assessed if this interfered with the beneficial behavioral effects
produced in rats treated with 1) VNS or 2) classical AD drugs, like
Prozac, to evaluate if VNS recruited biological systems beyond those
used by these classical drugs. Our study was the first to demonstrate
that VNS produces its antidepressant effects via the serotonergic system
and anxiolytic effects via the serotonergic as well as noradrenergic
systems. By contrast, classical antidepressants primarily recruit only
one of these neurotransmitter systems.

One of the most widely accepted theories for the pathophysiology of
depression is the neurotrophin theory, which suggests that stress causes
reduction of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in certain brain
areas. BDNF binds to its receptor and promotes survival and
proliferation of brain cells. Our study was the first to demonstrate
that VNS treatment recruits this system to produce its beneficial
behavioral effects whereas a classical AD drug called desipramine, does
not. Collectively, these studies show that unlike AD drugs, VNS therapy
recruits multiple biological pathways, which may begin to explain why it
is effective for TRD.
