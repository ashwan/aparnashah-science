- Led four journal club-style paper discussions that were central to each unit of the course.
- Designed assignments (with rubrics) based on these papers, accumulated relevant learning resources and monitored student performance on Goucher's Campus Pack Wiki, a collaborative space where multiple authors can create and contribute to one or more web pages that are linked together.
- Prepared questions and rubrics for final exams and graded all assignments and exams along with the lead instructor.
- Held weekly office hours.

#### Guest Lecturer, PSY 202: Human Learning and Memory (2016)
Goucher College, Baltimore, MD  
Class Size: 17
- Prepared and led a class session on *Classical Conditioning*.
- Began the session with 'KCA (knowledge, connection, application) Assessment', consisting of questions based on pre-class assignments, as formative assessment of students' learning level.
- Delivered the content using slides, videos, graphics and whiteboard illustrations.
- Ended the class session with an active learning exercise (Comic Strip Activity)

#### Instructor, Medical Neuroscience Discussion Group (2015)
University of Maryland School of Medicine  
Class Group Size: 13
- Created and led a multi-session discussion group for first year medical students entitled, 'Parkinson's disease -- a focus on non-motor symptoms'. Students were required to read relevant scientific papers assigned to them and lead presentations.They were graded on the basis of their performance and participation.

Description of the Discussion Group Topic: Parkinson's disease -- a focus on non-motor symptoms

The hallmark symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) include tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and loss of balance. However, a relatively wide range of non-motor symptoms are often seen over time, in patients, along with the motor symptoms. These symptoms include psychiatric disturbances (mood disorders, psychosis, cognitive dysfunction and impulse control disorders), sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal complications and pain. We will review possible causes, brain areas and circuitry involved in the manifestation of the psychiatric symptoms and discuss existing treatment options. As one may expect, these symptoms have a huge impact on the quality of a patient's life and warrant as much clinical and preclinical attention as the motor symptomatology associated with PD.

#### Active Learning Workshop (2019)
Created content for and co-led a workshop for faculty members of the Neuroscience Department at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine

Slides: <span class="inline-icon">[{{< icon name="file-powerpoint" pack="fas" >}}](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zJ7WfkjSc0fJMw1KyEwgVgYa6WyEotHUYA56rQkyAW4/)</span>

#### Reproducibility for Everyone (2019)
Organized a Professional Development Workshop at the Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting that was attended by \~ 250 participants (faculty members, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, technicians and non-academic members)

Description of the Workshop: Many new tools have been created to address barriers to reproducibility, but how do you know which ones to use? This workshop breaks down workflows and tools to help you improve the reproducibility of your work and covers several themes, such as data management, organization and documentation (electronic lab notebooks), protocol, reagent and data sharing, bioinformatics tools, data visualization and analysis. You will come away with ideas to implement in your lab as well as ideas for enhancing reproducibility more broadly. You will also learn a bit about sample sizes and educational programs that focus on enhancing reproducibility from the invited panelists, Drs. Robert Calin-Jageman and Gundula Bosch.

Selected Quote from Students' Feedback: "*I liked how much of a discussion it was, and I liked how she presented different quotes from all different types of people in the field on how they approach (and can be intimidated by) scientific papers. It was really encouraging! Maybe she could have included an example of a scientific paper and we could go through it together? It was still very helpful the way she did it - that\'s just a suggestion.*"

#### Drosofun (2007)
Conducted a workshop on Drosophila Functional Genomics, to screen RNAi fly lines for behavioral deficits in learning, for undergraduates at Sophia College for Women, India.

## Teaching-as-Research Fellowship (2018-19)

Project Abstract: Review sessions during undergraduate biology courses often involve revisiting material covered during several hour-long lectures. Depending on the course content, one has to often choose between going over most of the material superficially or emphasizing and discussing selected, key topics. In addition, it can be challenging to make the session interactive, especially with large class sizes.

As a Teaching-as-Research (TAR) Fellow, I aimed to identify and employ a strategy during a mid-course review session held before an exam that would be fast-paced, comprehensive, not \'teaching to the test', and involving student engagement. A secondary aim was to assess its effectiveness in enhancing student engagement and exam performance. Here I describe the use of a Defining Features Matrix for reviewing basic concepts of Psychopharmacology (Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics), discuss the method of its implementation in a class of over 50 students, and highlight some observations and potential implications.

Course: Psychopharmacology  
Class Size: 75
