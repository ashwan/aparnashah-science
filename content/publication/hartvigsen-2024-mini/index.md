abstract: Undergraduate neuroscience researchers and educators have a vital voice in working with policymakers to raise public awareness and increase support and funding for neuroscience. While there are many avenues and opportunities to become involved in neuroscience advocacy, finding the most effective training strategies, resources, and opportunities for involvement can sometimes be difficult and overwhelming. <br /><br /> To address this challenge and inform faculty of science advocacy opportunities for undergraduates, we organized a mini-symposium at the 2023 Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience (FUN) Workshop. Attendees had the opportunity to engage with a panel of experts with diverse experiences in neuroscience advocacy and policy. Topics presented and discussed included the importance of advocacy, effective training practices and resources, advice for scientific communication with a non-scientific audience, and various opportunities for advocacy involvement for undergraduate students. <br /><br /> We share here our rationale and goals as we set out to plan this mini-symposium, a brief description of each panelistâ€™s career trajectory, relevant resources, and major takeaways. We reflect on the lessons learned from this session and recognize the need for an on-going conversation about careers involving science policy, science communication training, and opportunities for undergraduate students. Accordingly, we share future directions and recommendations to help faculty equip not only themselves but also their undergraduate trainees with the knowledge, practical skills, and resources required to engage with their communities as informed citizens.
