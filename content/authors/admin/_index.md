Hi! I am a neuroscientist who believes that discovering answers to the 'Why?' and 'How?' questions about our brains is empowering. These answers help us understand ourselves and those around us better. I have over ten years of research experience on a wide array of brain disorders, ranging from mental health illnesses, such as anxiety, depression and substance use disorders to neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease. Most recently, I was investigating the role of microRNAs in neuronal plasticity and stress-related psychiatric disorders and was awarded a Young Investigator Grant by the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation in 2018 to initiate this novel line of research. I am a former President of the [Association for Women in Science - Baltimore Chapter](http://www.awisbaltimore.org/).
