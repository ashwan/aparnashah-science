Aparna Shah, collegiate assistant professor of neuroscience in the College of Science, said the peer support within the Fellowship has enabled her to envision how her Neuroscience of Drug Addiction students could reach more community partners.

“Last summer, I had probably one or two ideas for partnerships,” she said, while her students’ current service projects show how her vision for community partnerships has grown during her first community-based teaching experience:
