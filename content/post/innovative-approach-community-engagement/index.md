Eunju Hwang, an associate professor in the [Department of Apparel, Housing, and Resource Management](https://liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/apparel-housing-and-resource-management.html), is passionate about fostering reflection and collaboration among faculty engaged in service learning. Hwang and Aparna Shah, assistant professor in the School of Neuroscience, will help present, “Charting Pathways for Sustainable Community-Engaged/Service Learning” at the ESC conference.

Their presentation will focus on the value of group reflection that came from the 2023-24 [VT Engage Faculty Fellows](https://news.vt.edu/articles/2024/02/sa-vt-engage-fellows.html) cohort, an interdisciplinary group who worked together to develop and teach community-engaged projects.

“I am excited to represent Virginia Tech and the VT Engage Faculty Fellows team,” Hwang said. “In the Universal Design course that I teach, I hope to develop intergenerational activities that students can contribute to local communities practicing age-friendly initiatives.  Then, when Virginia Tech hosts ESC in Roanoke in 2025, the students in Universal Design can showcase their intergenerational engagements with local communities including Roanoke.”
